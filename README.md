# Birthday_Notification_Web-site
Birthday Notification Web-site created using create-react-app

The app contains 7 files and 6 images.
The images used are stored in cloudinary(An interactive UI enabling your users to upload media from a variety of sources for immediate use on your website or mobile app.). 


Created several js files to avoid reduntant typing. 
All the image files are imported in data.js. 
All the internal files are imported in app.js(data, list) and also the general structure for the component. That makes it easier to add more interesting features to this project.
The index.css contains all the styles in action.
list.js with the general structure of the persons' birthday.
manifest.json has the icon parameters.



Requirements.
Run npm install && npm start.
